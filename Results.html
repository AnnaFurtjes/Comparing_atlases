<p>These plots suggest that there is a non-linear relationship between morphometricity and number of ROIs contained in the atlas. Below, we present linear regression betas for logarithmically transformed variables; such a linear-log model is a common way to describe non-linear relationships (intuitive explanation <a href="https://kenbenoit.net/assets/courses/ME104/logmodels2.pdf#:~:text=Logarithmically%20transforming%20variables%20in%20a%20regression%20model%20is,effectiverelationship%20non-linear%2C%20while%20still%20preserving%20the%20linear%20model">here</a>).</p>
<p>Linear-log model:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Yi = \alpha + \beta log(Xi) + \epsilon i \]</span></p>
<p>In our case, outcome variable Y is morphometricity and predictor variable X is log transformed number of ROIs in an atlas.</p>
<p>Beta in this equation tells us the expected change in morphometricity when the number of ROIs are multiplied by Euler’s number e (approx. 2.72).</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Beta is the expected change in morphometricity when number of ROIs increase by 172%</p>

<p>The R2 estimates range between 98 and 56, with a mean of 84.5714286 and a standard deviation of 11.8935757</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>Interpretation:</em></p>
<p>For morphometricity estimates of age based on SurfArea data, we expect an increase in morphometricity by 4.5 units with an increase of log(number of ROIs).</p>
<p>In order to calculate the expected morphometricity based on the chosen number of ROIs, the user may find the appropriate intercept and beta and calculate the expected morphometricity like so:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ morphometricity = \beta * log(numROI) + \alpha \]</span></p>
<p>For example, the expected morphometricity for age using SurfArea data represented in an atlas with 200.000 ROIs is 66.93%.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 4.5 * log(200.000) + 12 = 66,93 \]</span> <br></p>
<p>It is noteworthy in this data that ThickAvg always (no exception!) yields the smallest betas, followed by GrayVol, while SurfArea always has the largest betas, demonstrating that SurfArea is more susceptible towards change in atlas dimensionality.</p>
<p>Also, the standard errors of is always smaller for ThickAvg suggesting that the estimates the relationship is calculated on are more consistent.</p>

<p>These numbers are actually very similar, and considering we don’t have confidence intervals associated with BIC estimates, we can’t really interpret these numbers and conclude that one measurement type is more consistent than the other.</p>
<hr />
<p>We found that the Schaefer atlas often does better than other atlases in predicting age &amp; sex, but the BIC displayed a worse fit. It is hard to judge this because we have no confidence intervals for the BIC but we thought we should double check whether some areas have extreme outliers. Ideally, we would check the distributions of all 500 regions, but that is not practical. Instead, we take the regions with the largest effects in the LASSO analyses and plot their distributions.</p>

<h1>4. Cross-atlas Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs)</h1>
<p>Cross-atlas LRTs were performed to quantify whether a higher dimensional atlas added explained variance in addition to the variance explained by a lower dimensional atlas. For example, first we fitted morphometricity using DK (68 ROIs) and Destrieux (148 ROIs) brain measures in one model. Second, we dropped Destrieux from the model and recalculated morphometricity for DK alone, which allows to quantify the percentage of variance explained by Destrieux in addition to the variance already explained by DK (“added morphometricity”). The LRT quantifies whether the explanatory variance added by the higher dimensional atlas (i.e., Destrieux in this example) is larger than zero.</p>
<p>The first code chunk displays the raw percentages of variance explained by those models. We chose not to use this in the manuscript as it’s hard to interpret and summarise.</p>

<p>Alternative visualisation is to display the relative increase in morphometricity that we get by adding the more complex atlas to the equation.</p>
<p>To put the LRT results into perspective, we report the morphometricity estimate of the lower dimensional atlas divided by the sum of the variance explained by both atlases combined, which will reflect the relative improvement made to the model by adding the higher dimensional atlas. A ratio of 1 indicates no increase in morphometricity when adding the higher dimensional atlas to the equation, and a ratio larger than 1 indicates the proportional increase in morphometricity grained by adding the higher dimensional atlas. None of the indices are below 1 as the combined morphometricity estimate from two atlases cannot be smaller than the estimate yielded by one atlas alone.</p>
<p>We obtain this relative increase as the total variance explained by both atlases divided by the morph estimate of the lower dimensional atlas. For example, DK explains 25% SurfArea morphometricity in age by itself. DK and Des together explain 52% in age. 52%/25% = 2.08 suggesting that adding the higher dimensional atlas increased the estimate by about double.</p>
<p>V_G/ morph = 1 suggests that there was no added morphometricity by adding the more complex atlas. V_G/ morph &lt; 1 suggests there was an increase in morphomtricity by adding the more complex atlas.</p>

<p>On average, adding the more complex atlas improved the morphometricity estimate by double (average sum_G/morph ratio = 2.37).</p>
<p>If we look at this split by measurement type:</p>
<ul>
<li>average ratio GrayVol = 2.7</li>
<li>average ratio SurfArea = 2.73</li>
<li>average ratio ThickAvg = 1.67</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of all models, 12 models were not significant suggesting that most models had an increase in morphometricity when adding the more complex/ high dimensional atlas.</p>
<p>These non-significant models were all for brain measures of SurfArea and for alcohol and cigarette consumption. These models operated very close to the boundaries of the feature space and had very small estimates for individual atlases as well as combined models. The average morphometricity estimates for atlases alone was 2.46 and the combined estimate (sum_G) was 4.</p>

<h2>6.1 Sanity checking cross-atlas comparisons (cortical thickness, age &amp; sex)</h2>
<p>Unexpectedly, there was a divergence from the general pattern (vertex-wise measures accounting for the most variance) for morphometricity of age and sex, specifically from cortical thickness measures. Across these two sets of estimates, we found that two lower-dimensional atlases together explained more variance than the vertex-wise measures. Average thickness estimates for age were 29% [21-35%] for DK alone, and 30% [25-36%] for Destrieux alone, but together DK and Destrieux explained 63% [58-68%] which was substantially larger than the vertex-wise estimates of 37% [36-39%]. Note that confidence intervals from the latter two estimates are not overlapping. Similarly, average thickness estimates for sex were 31% [24-38%] for DK alone, 33% [28-38%] for Destrieux alone, but 72% [67-76%] for DK and Destrieux together, compared with only 49% [47-50%] explained by the vertex-wise measurements.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is possible that these effects were inflated as the variance attributed to the second atlas was dominated by few ROIs with large effects. As we force the random effects in the LMMs to be normally distributed this could shift the distribution and artificially increase the variance explained. We can test this by fitting two variance components for each atlas in which we split the features into two parts (median split of effect sizes).</p>
<p><br> Analysis steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Get linear association betas between each ROI in the individual atlases &amp; behavioural traits</p></li>
<li><p>Perform median split based on the association betas</p></li>
<li><p>Create bod and BRM files for split atlases</p></li>
<li><p>Fit linear models with two variance components per atlas (i.e., 4 variance components altogether) and report joint variance explained</p></li>

<h2>6.2.1 Normalise Schaefer atlas data and fit LASSO model again</h2>
<p>We saw in the LMMs that Schaefer estimates were inflated due to non-normal distributions. In the LASSO models, we see a drop in prediction accuracy probably for the same reason (violation of the normal assumption). Here we test whether the estimates increase when we normalise the Schaefer atlas data first.</p>
</div>
<div id="fit-pcs-to-predict-behaviours" class="section level2">
<h2>6.2.2 Fit PCs to predict behaviours</h2>
<p>Here we’re predicting phenotypes with the first PC of an atlas in a linear regression model. We aim to explore why we find better predicitve ability for thickness in some traits, and better predicitve ability for surface area in other traits.</p>
<p>We suggest the results depend on how well the LASSO model picks up on shared variance between features (as it’s dropping non-representative features).</p>
<p>If we found that this first PC did better for thickness than surface area in predicting age and BMI, but worse than surface area in predicting sex (and made no difference for cognitive ability), then maybe we could take that as evidence that these LASSO models mainly pick up on variance shared between features. Potentially that could explain why we observe an asymptote in the LASSO <a href="Results.html#5_LASSO_regressions">Figure above</a>; more fine-grained atlases only do better when you substantially increase the number of features to 300,000.</p>
<p><br> Analysis steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Extract first PC of an atlas and represent in individual-level space.</p></li>
<li><p>Use linear regression model to predict behavioural phenotype with PC.</p></li>
<li><p>Report variance explained.</p></li>
